# 3D Reference Organ for Brain, Female v1.0
## Brain 3D Organ Female v1.0

### Description
This reference organ was created using data from the "Allen Human Reference Atlas â€“ 3D, 2020" representing one half of the human brain (Ding et al., 2016). The 141 anatomical structures were mirrored to arrive at a whole human brain (as intended) and resized to fit the Visible Human Male and Female bodies.

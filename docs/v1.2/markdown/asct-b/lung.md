description: '[Anatomical Structures, Cell Types, plus Biomarkers (ASCT+B) tables](https://hubmapconsortium.github.io/ccf/pages/ccf-anatomical-structures.html) aim to capture the nested *part_of* structure of anatomical human body parts, the typology of cells, and biomarkers used to identify cell types. The tables are authored and reviewed by an international team of experts. This Single Lung Lobe table simplifies the ASCT+B table from Lung v1.1, to consider the anatomical and cellular composition of  the lower respiratory tract of one lung lobe as representative of the five human lung lobes, reducing table redundancies in structure and cell nomenclature and to improve visualization by the ASCT+B Reporter.

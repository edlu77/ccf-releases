release_version: v1.2
model_type: omap
description: 'The OMAP Skin panel was designed for Cell DIVETM multiplexed imaging of formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) human skin.  The panel contains 18 antibodies and the nuclear marker DAPI for image registration and nuclear segmentation.  Antigens were detected using either primary antibodies with fluorophore-labelled secondary antibodies or fluorescent dye conjugated antibodies. This OMAP provides a spatial context for most anatomical structures and cell types present in the [ASCT+B skin table, v1.1](https://doi.org/10.48539/HBM423.RTRR.746).  Additionally, the inclusion of protein biomarkers DDB2 and p53 allow for profiling of skin damage and aging effects. The panel was designed to get a broad representation of cell types found in the skin and in the future will be expanded to include dermal dendritic cell (DC) markers (e.g. Langerin, CD11c).'

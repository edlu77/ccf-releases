release_version: v1.2
model_type: omap
description: 'The OMAP Lymph Node panel was designed for IBEX (Iterative Bleaching Extends multi-pleXity) imaging of fixed frozen human lymph nodes. The panel contains 39 antibodies and the nuclear marker Hoechst 33342 for image alignment and nuclear segmentation. This OMAP provides a spatial context for all anatomical structures and most cell types present in the [ASCT+B lymph node table, v1.1](https://doi.org/10.48539/HBM573.SHCQ.259). Additionally, the inclusion of protein biomarkers BCL2 and CD10 and CD138 and CD44 allow profiling of lymph node disease states, e.g.  follicular lymphoma malignancy and metastasis, respectively. The core and essential protein biomarkers detailed here overlap (~50-85%) with panels developed for multiplexed imaging of lymphoid samples using other technologies  and sample preparations [Kennedy-Darling et al](https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.31657.001), [Lin et al](https://doi.org/10.1002/eji.202048891). This OMAP does not contain antibodies for typing pericytes, plasmacytoid dendritic cells, or different T helper lineages in situ. '

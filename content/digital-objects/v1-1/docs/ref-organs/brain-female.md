description: '[This reference organ](https://hubmapconsortium.github.io/ccf/pages/ccf-3d-reference-library.html) was created using data from the "[Allen Human Reference Atlas â€“ 3D, 2020](https://doi.org/10.1002/cne.24080)" representing one half of the human brain (Ding et al., 2016). The 141 anatomical structures were mirrored to arrive at a whole human brain (as intended) and resized to fit the Visible Human Male and Female bodies.'

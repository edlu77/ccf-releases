description: '[Anatomical Structures, Cell Types, plus Biomarkers (ASCT+B) tables](https://hubmapconsortium.github.io/ccf/pages/ccf-anatomical-structures.html) aim to capture the nested *part_of* structure of anatomical human body parts, the typology of cells, and biomarkers used to identify cell types. The tables are authored and reviewed by an international team of experts. Only cell types and biomarkers for the primary motor cortex are represented in the table currently [(Bakken et al. 2021)](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-021-03465-8.)'
